# Consulting
Repo to store code that I was asked to review. This repo has no overall purpose, but is a bin for random bits of code and data that people sent to me to ask for my advice. Storing this here gives me the opportunity to track changes and show the differences I made to the code if the people seeking advice do not have their own Git repo.
